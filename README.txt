Instructions:

	To run this code, you must have the JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your system. To run it from the command line, navigate to the directory containing the project and run 'javac *.java' to compile it, then run 'java Main' to execute the test case from the instructions. Alternatively, you could open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ and simply hit run.

How to Improve Assignment:

	To improve this assignment, I would suggest making the instructions clearer. Since we are just a class for this assignment, it was very unclear whether or not we were required to write a main method.	Additionally, it was unclear what should happen if begin_transaction() is called when there is already a transaction in progress. Should it throw an exception? Despite these flaws, I did really enjoy this assignment and found the instructions to be clearer than some other assignments for this class.
